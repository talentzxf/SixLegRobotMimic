# QT Core needs to be installed with

# You'll need to copy over sip and PyQt5 to your Raspberry Pi (I used SFTP). Just put the tar files someplace that you can get to them easily.
#
# You'll need to extract each of them, using the tar command, with the -xzvf tag so you'll end up with tar -xzvf sip-4.19.1.tar.gz`for sip.
#
# In each folder, you'll need to set up for the build. This is done by typing "python config.py" in each directory.
#
# The contents of each directory needs to be built and installed, go to your sip folder and type "make" this will take a very long time. After it's through, type "sudo make install".
